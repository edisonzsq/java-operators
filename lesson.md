## Brief

### How to use the lesson sample code

There are two folders prepared for the lesson. 
- [Instructor's folder](./lesson-sample-code/instructor-demo-code)
- [Learners' folder](./lesson-sample-code/learners-practice-code)

Instructor to use the code provided for demonstration during the I DO segment. Learners will use the java file provided in the respective folder for practice during the WE DO segment.

### Using Run Code extension

In the previous lesson, learners are encouraged to use the `javac` and `java` command to run Java codes. From this lesson onwards, instructors and learners may utilize the VS Code extension "Run Code" to run the Java code.

For run code to work, the filename and class name must be identical. Example, a `Demo.java` should have a class name `Demo`.

## Part 1 - Arithmetic Operators

Instructors may refer to the sample code prepared [here](./lesson-sample-code/instructor-demo-code/ArithmeticDemo.java) and code from scratch when giving demonstration to the student.

After demo, learners will attempt to practice [here](./lesson-sample-code/learners-practice-code/ArithmeticPractice.java).

## Part 2 - Comparison & Assignment Operators

Instructors may refer to the sample code prepared [here](./lesson-sample-code/instructor-demo-code/ComparisonAndAssignmentDemo.java) and code from scratch when giving demonstration to the student.

After demo, learners will attempt to practice [here](./lesson-sample-code/learners-practice-code/ComparisonAndAssignmentPractice.java).

## Part 3 - Logical Operators

Instructors may refer to the sample code prepared [here](./lesson-sample-code/instructor-demo-code/LogicDemo.java) and code from scratch when giving demonstration to the student.

After demo, learners will attempt to practice [here](./lesson-sample-code/learners-practice-code/LogicPractice.java).
